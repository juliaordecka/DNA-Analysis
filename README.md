# DNA-Analysis ðŸ§¬

A work-in-progress app designed for basic text-format DNA sequence analysis, which allows to perform operations on DNA sequences stored in a database. The purpose of the project is to learn .NET technologies and Angular.

The app implements the following functionalities:

- Finds the number of nucleotides (A/T/C/G) in a sequence  
- Creates a complementary sequence (A â†’ T, T â†’ A, C â†’ G, G â†’ C) to a given sequence  
- Creates a reverse sequence to a given sequence  
- Creates a reverse-complementary sequence to a given sequence  
- Converts a DNA sequence to a RNA sequence  
- Checks whether a given substring (for example a codon or a motif) is present in a sequence and returns the positions of the substrings in the sequence.
